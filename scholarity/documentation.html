                    <h4>1.3 Semantic Web and RDF</h4>
                    <p>The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web that aims to make web content more
                    machine-readable and understandable by computers.
                    It is based on the idea that information on the web should be not only accessible to humans but also
                    structured and linked in a way that allows computers to understand and process it.
                    The Semantic Web is an initiative led by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the same organization
                    that develops web standards.
                    Key components and principles of the Semantic Web include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            RDF (Resource Description Framework): RDF is a standard for describing resources on
                            the web and their relationships. It uses triples (subject-predicate-object statements) to
                            represent data, providing a flexible and extensible way to model information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ontologies: Ontologies provide a formal way to define relationships and concepts
                            within a specific domain. They help establish a shared understanding of terms and their
                            meanings, allowing for more precise and consistent representation of data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Linked Data: The concept of Linked Data involves interconnecting data on the web by
                            using standardized identifiers (URIs) and RDF triples. This allows information from one
                            source to be linked to related information in other sources, creating a web of linked and
                            discoverable data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language): SPARQL is a query language for
                            querying RDF data. It enables developers and applications to retrieve specific information
                            from RDF datasets, supporting powerful queries for extracting knowledge from linked data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Inference: In the Semantic Web, reasoning engines can be used to infer additional
                            information based on the explicit data and relationships defined in RDF. This helps derive
                            new knowledge and make connections that might not be immediately apparent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Web Ontology Language (OWL): OWL is a language for defining ontologies on the
                            Semantic Web. It provides more expressive power than RDF, allowing the creation of complex
                            relationships and classifications.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The goal of the Semantic Web is to enhance data interoperability,
                    enable better data integration, and facilitate automated reasoning and decision-making.
                    It has applications in various domains, including search engines, data integration, knowledge
                    representation, and the development of intelligent agents.
                    By providing a standardized framework for representing and linking data, the Semantic Web aims to
                    transform the web into a more intelligent and interconnected information space.</p>

                <section>
                    <h4>Connection between RDF and recommendations systems</h4>
                    <p>The connection between RDF (Resource Description Framework) and recommendation systems lies in the
                    ability of RDF to represent structured and linked data,
                    making it suitable for modeling and capturing the complex relationships between users, items, and
                    their characteristics. RDF provides a flexible and standardized way to express data
                    , and this can be leveraged in recommendation systems to enhance the representation of user
                    preferences, item features, and the connections between them. Here's how RDF is connected to
                    recommendation systems:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Representation of User and Item Profiles</h5>
                            - RDF allows you to represent user profiles and item descriptions using triples. Users,
                            items, and their attributes can be modeled as resources, and relationships between them can
                            be expressed as predicates. This enables a more detailed and structured representation of
                            user preferences and item features compared to traditional approaches.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Capture of Rich Metadata</h5>
                            - RDF facilitates the inclusion of rich metadata about users and items. Properties, such as
                            genres, authors, tags, and other relevant attributes, can be linked to users' preferences
                            and item descriptions. This additional information enhances the understanding of user
                            preferences and item characteristics, leading to more accurate recommendations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Modeling User-Item Interactions:</h5>
                            - Interactions between users and items, such as ratings, likes, or views, can be represented
                            using RDF triples. This modeling allows for a nuanced and detailed description of user-item
                            interactions, enabling the system to learn from explicit and implicit feedback.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5> Incorporation of Contextual Information. </h5>
                            - RDF is well-suited for incorporating contextual information into recommendation systems.
                            Contextual factors, such as time, location, and device, can be modeled using RDF triples,
                            providing a comprehensive view of the circumstances in which user-item interactions occur.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Facilitation of Linked Data and Collaborative Filtering:</h5>
                            - RDF's ability to support linked data is crucial for collaborative filtering approaches.
                            Relationships between users and items, as well as connections between items themselves, can
                            be represented using RDF. This enables collaborative filtering algorithms to identify
                            patterns and similarities between users and items, contributing to more effective
                            recommendations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Integration with External Knowledge Graphs:</h5>
                            - RDF allows recommendation systems to integrate external knowledge graphs and ontologies.
                            By connecting user and item data with broader knowledge, the system can benefit from a more
                            comprehensive understanding of the domain, leading to improved recommendations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Querying and Inference:</p>
                            - SPARQL queries can be employed to retrieve relevant information from RDF datasets,
                            facilitating the extraction of user preferences and item features. Inference mechanisms
                            based on RDF data can be used to derive additional knowledge, enhancing the recommendation
                            process.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>In summary, RDF provides a structured and linked data representation that can be leveraged to model
                    complex relationships in recommendation systems.
                    It enables a more detailed and flexible representation of user preferences, item features, and their
                    interactions, contributing to the development of more accurate and personalized recommendation
                    algorithms. The use of RDF aligns well with the principles of the Semantic Web and Linked Data,
                    providing a foundation for building intelligent and interconnected recommendation systems.</p>

                    <p>
                        Normal users who wish to use the application for social purposes.

                    <h4>1.5 RDF Configuration</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our system's RDF-based knowledge model is organized around an extensive collection of classes
                        and characteristics, each of which is intended to capture and represent a particular facet of
                        the domain. These components make it possible to accurately and completely represent entities
                        and their connections inside the system.
                    </p>
                    <section>
                        <h5>Classes</h5>
                        <p>
                            The classes Author, Book, City, Skill, User, BookAuthorAssociation, Company, SimilarBooks,
                            UserBookInteraction, and UserMapping are the foundation of our model; they provide an
                            organized way to classify the domain entities. Because every class has a distinct URI,
                            entities can be easily identified and linkable throughout the dataset. To distinguish
                            between authors from other entity types like books or users, the system includes an Author
                            class.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Properties</h5>
                        <p>book, author, averageRating, city, company, rating, title, email, imageUrl, locale, user,
                            user_id_long, isKnown, name, similarBook, and userName: These properties define the
                            attributes of classes or the relationships between them. They are used to describe specific
                            characteristics of an entity (like a user's email or a book's title) or to link entities
                            together (such as associating a book with its author).
                        </p>

                        <h5>Expressiveness and Real Usage</h5>
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The expressiveness of this model lies in its ability to accurately describe the complex
                                relationships and attributes found within the system's domain.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Each entity, whether it be a user, book, or company, is given a unique URI and described
                                using a set of properties that capture its essential attributes. This enables a rich,
                                detailed representation of the domain data.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The model captures relationships between entities, such as the association between books
                                and authors or 'books' and their similar counterparts, through properties like 'book'
                                and 'similarBook'. These relationships are vital for understanding the connections and
                                interactions within the domain.

                            </li>

                            <li>
                                The use of rdf:type allows for the classification of entities under specific classes,
                                facilitating the organization of data and supporting more efficient querying and data
                                retrieval. For example, distinguishing between different types of interactions or
                                associations enables tailored processing and analysis.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The standardized RDF format and the use of URIs for entity identification promote data
                                integration and interoperability. This structured approach makes it easier to merge data
                                from different sources or to link data within the system to external datasets, enhancing
                                the model's utility and extending its reach.
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h5>Taxonomy</h5>
                        <p>
                            The taxonomy within the model is reflected in the hierarchical classification of entities
                            and concepts. In order to organize data in a way that accurately represents relationships
                            and categories found in the real world, a hierarchical structure is essential.

                            Entities such as City, Company, and Skill are organized in a taxonomy that reflects
                            geographical, industrial, or skill-related hierarchies, respectively. This organization
                            allows for the aggregation of data at different levels (e.g., by city, sector, or
                            expertise), facilitating more nuanced analysis and querying.
                            The taxonomy aids in categorizing entities under broader concepts, enhancing the system's
                            ability to filter, search, and recommend content.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Ontology</h5>
                        <p>The ontology aspect of the model goes a step further by defining the set of concepts and
                            categories in the domain and specifying the relationships and properties that link these
                            concepts. It encapsulates not just the hierarchical structures but also the complex, often
                            nuanced relationships between entities.
                            Beyond simple hierarchical classifications, the ontology captures a wide array of
                            relationships (such as authorship, ownership, or geographic location) and constraints that
                            define how entities relate to each other.


                        </p>
                        <p>For example, the BookAuthorAssociation class explicitly models the relationship between books
                            and authors, while properties like similarBook capture the nuanced concept of similarity
                            between books.
                        <p>The ontology supports logical inference, allowing the system to deduce new information from
                            the existing data. For instance, if two books share a significant number of similar
                            attributes or are frequently referenced together, the system might infer a similarity
                            relationship, even if not explicitly stated.
                            By adhering to standardized ontologies, the model enhances its interoperability with other
                            systems and datasets. This standardization facilitates the integration of external data
                            sources, enriching the system's knowledge base and providing users with a more comprehensive
                            dataset.

                            The use of a controlled vocabulary within the ontology ensures consistent terminology across
                            the system. This consistency is crucial for effective data retrieval and analysis, as it
                            reduces ambiguity and enhances the precision of queries and algorithms.</p>

                <h4>2.1 Facebook </h4>

                <p>Facebook collects extensive data on user behavior, including interactions, likes, comments, shares,
                    and clicks. This data is crucial for understanding user preferences and interests.
                    Facebook likely employs content-based filtering, where user preferences are inferred based on the
                    content they interact with. For example,
                    the system may analyze the types of posts, articles, videos, and advertisements a user engages with
                    to understand their interests.[5] </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Collaborative filtering involves making recommendations based on the preferences of similar
                        users.
                        Facebook may use collaborative filtering to recommend content that users with similar interests
                        have found engaging.
                        This can be done at the user level (user-to-user collaborative filtering) or at the item level
                        (content-to-content collaborative filtering).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Given the social nature of Facebook, the platform likely leverages the social graph.
                        Recommendations might be influenced by the activities and preferences of a user's friends or
                        connections.
                        If a user's friends engage with certain content, it may be more likely to be recommended to that
                        user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Facebook's recommendation system is likely dynamic and adjusts in real-time based on user
                        behavior and changes in preferences.
                        It may consider recent interactions and trends to provide up-to-date recommendations.
                        Facebook employs machine learning models to process and analyze the vast amount of data it
                        collects.
                        These models can be trained to predict user preferences and generate personalized
                        recommendations.
                    </li>
                    <li> With the increasing diversity of content types on Facebook, including text, images, and videos,
                        the recommendation system may be designed to handle multi-modal data, providing recommendations
                        across different content formats.

                    <p>
                        Sore-Modular system able to recommend certain items of interest
                        (people,places,music,books, hobbies)
                        according to a given knowledge graph expressed in RDF and automatically built for
                        a specific user – for example, based on her/his social media profile(s)
                        – by considering multiple similar features/properties.
                        For instance, suggesting the members of an IT team based on desired
                        skills, geographic location (i.e. from Romania and Chile only),
                        technical preferences (e.g., using free software), background info
                        (education, occupation history, driving license,other competencies) and so on.
                        The system should be "smart" enough to improve recommendations based on various methods such
                        as user feedback, reasoning, and/or machine learning. The recommended items will be
                        available via a SPARQL endpoint.

                    <h4>3.2 Product Approach</h4>
                    <P> Product approch is based on the paper <a role="doc-biblioref"> Linked Data to build Recommender
                            Systems[1]</a> by Alexandre Passant.
                        This paper explores the utilization of Semantic Web technologies, specifically the Linked Open
                        Data (LOD) project, in the development of a new generation of recommender systems.
                        Unlike traditional systems using private datasets, the paper demonstrates how LOD, with its
                        public, collaboratively created, and semantically structured data, facilitates cross-domain
                        recommendations.
                        This approach enables the portability of data between systems without altering the
                        recommendation algorithm's implementation. The contributions include an overview of the LOD
                        community effort,
                        evaluation of semantic-distance and collaborative-filtering approaches, a method for assessing
                        recommendations using existing categorical data, and a reference architecture for cross-domain
                        recommender
                        systems using Linked Data.</P>
                    <p>The paper proposes a content-based recommendation approach using semantic distance algorithms
                        based on Linked Data principles.
                        It introduces six Linked Data Distance (LDD) algorithms, including variations such as LDDs,
                        LDDws, LDDo, LDDwo, LDDc, and LDDwc.
                        These algorithms compute the distance between entities in the Web of Data, offering a unique
                        perspective compared to traditional semantic distance approaches.</p>
                    <p>A use-case is presented where a recommender system is developed using data from DBpedia,
                        providing recommendations for over 30,000 artists. User evaluations indicate that the LDDwc
                        algorithm is considered the most accurate.</p>
                    <p>
                        Also the document briefly mentions the potential for cross-domain recommendations, highlighting
                        that the distance algorithms consider relationships between entities, leading to recommendations
                        that share commonalities with the query URI.
                    </p>
                    Taking this article as mani point of reference we'll try to build an app which make recommendations
                    based on distances between concepts

                            microservices, and user profile microservices, all of which interact to form a comprehensive
                            recommendation engine.</p>
                        <h5>RDF Microservice</h5>
                        <p>
                            The RDF microservice acts as a core component for querying and manipulating RDF data. It
                            provides endpoints for accessing detailed information about books, cities, companies,
                            skills, and authors, leveraging SPARQL queries to fetch data from an RDF store. This
                            microservice is fundamental for extracting the necessary data to support the recommendation
                            logic, which includes:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fetching book details and associated authors, leveraging RDF's graph structure to
                                aggregate data such as titles, ratings, and author names.
                            </li>
                            <li>Querying entities like cities, companies, and skills to support filtering and
                                recommendation criteria based on user preferences or profile data.
                            </li>
                            <li>Enabling complex queries through a POST endpoint that accepts SPARQL queries directly,
                                providing flexibility for dynamic recommendation scenarios.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Recommendation Microservice</h5>
                        <p>The recommendation microservice is dedicated to generating personalized recommendations for
                            users, focusing on books and songs in this implementation. It interacts with external
                            prediction services to obtain recommendation data, which is then enriched by querying the
                            RDF store for detailed information. Key features include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Book recommendations based on user IDs, where the service calls an external prediction
                                API and then fetches detailed book information from the RDF microservice.
                            </li>
                            <li>Music recommendations that similarly leverage external prediction services to suggest
                                songs based on user preferences or profiles.
                            </li>
                            <li>The ability to process and return recommendations in a structured format, making it easy
                                for clients to consume and display the recommended items.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>User Profile Microservice</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collecting and storing user data from various sources, which can be used to enhance the
                                personalization of recommendations.
                            </li>
                            <li>Providing endpoints for retrieving user information, enabling user-based filtering and
                                recommendations.
                            </li>
                            <li>Managing user interactions and feedback, which can be used to refine and improve the
                                recommendation algorithms.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h5>Technical Integration and Data Flow</h5>
                        <p>The system's architecture is designed for modularity and scalability, with each microservice
                            handling a distinct aspect of the recommendation process. Integration is achieved through
                            RESTful APIs and direct HTTP requests between services. The data flow typically
                            involves:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>User data is collected via the user profile microservice from various social media
                                platforms and stored in a database.
                            </li>
                            <li>The recommendation microservice fetches user-specific data and queries external APIs to
                                generate preliminary recommendation lists.
                            </li>
                            <li>For items like books and music, detailed information is fetched from the RDF
                                microservice by querying the RDF store with SPARQL.
                            </li>
                            <li>The enriched recommendations are returned to the user, providing personalized
                                suggestions based on the comprehensive analysis of their profile and preferences.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

            <h3>6. Product and linked data principles </h3>
            <p>In computing, linked data (often capitalized as Linked Data)
                describes a method of publishing structured data so that it can
                be interlinked and become more useful through semantic
                queries. It builds upon standard Web technologies such as
                HTTP, RDF and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web
                pages for human readers, it extends them to share information
                in a way that can be read automatically by computers. This
                enables data from different sources to be connected and
                queried.</p>
            <p>Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web and Linked Data
                initiator, suggested a 5 star deployment scheme for Open Data:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format)
                    under an open license</li>
                <li>make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel instead
                    of image scan of a table)</li>
                <li>use non-proprietary formats (e.g., CSV instead of Excel)</li>
                <li>use URIs to denote things, so that people can point at
                    your stuff</li>
                <li>link your data to other data to provide context</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>When creating data for project we hardly tried to follow steps 4 and 5 making data as simple as
                    possible that we can reuse each entity.
                    A good example is from user data from chapter 2.4 where it can be seen that the thing user contains
                    uris to other entities. And an expanded view over this
                    type of representation of data can be seen at <a
                        href="https://github.com/Iustin07/wade/blob/users_rdf/people_data.rdf">https://github.com/Iustin07/wade/blob/users_rdf/people_data.rdf</a>
                </li>
                <li>Using a uniform referencing pattern using '/' in uris.</li>
                <li>Also use schema.org and FOAF to conect out data to other concepts that's already existing.</li>
            </ul>
